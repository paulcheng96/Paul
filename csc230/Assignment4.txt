 Part I

Assignment 4 is to re-implement Assignment 3 in C, rather than assembly language.

I've posted some sample code in Resources->a4.

You will need to create a new C project and then add the following files to "Source Files" (right click, add existing)

a4.c

lcd_drv.c

And then add the following to "Header Files" (right click, add existing):

lcd_drv.h

main.h

mydefs.h

I've also included some code that uses the A2D to read the buttons in button.c.  You should NOT include this code directly, you'll need to turn it into a function, but you are free to copy and paste it as you like.

IMPORTANT:

In Lab 9 you will be shown some changes you have to make to the project settings in order to make C projects work.  Don't forget to make those changes to your assignment 4 project too! (See page 2 of the Lab9 notes).
